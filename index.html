            <p>It was an insane Fashion Month. I've never experienced so many people out in the streets— from kids with iPhones trying to get their 'golden selfie' with a supermodel, to tourists with cameras vying for pictures for who-knows-what. Whatever the reason, each season street style photographers face new challenges out there. Mine was a trip that started in noisy and chaotic NYC, where I almost got kicked by Bella Hadid's bodyguard for no specific reason. Next stop was—of course—rainy and cold London.

            <p>For the third leg, I hit the European continent and the 'pizza and pasta paradise' of Milan, the perfect place to get my batteries recharged—the weather was nice and the Italians keep smiling and serving espressos to keep us awake. The final leg of my fashion tour commenced in majestic Paris—where after the 4th day you can't believe there's still 4 more days to go. But we all survived another four fashion weeks—here is a small selection of some of my favorite moments throughout the month.</p>

            <p class="bold">Fashion</p><p> is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while "fashion" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Early Western travelers, traveling whether to Persia, Turkey, India, or China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion in the respective places. </p>

            <p>The Japanese Shogun's secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years.[4] However, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing. The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. Historians, including James Laver and Fernand Braudel, date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the 14th century,[9][10] though it should be noted that they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery[11] and illuminated manuscripts were not common before the fourteenth century.</p>
